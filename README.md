## Description

Project #1 for the University of Texas at Austin specified that we create an application that tied together everything we have learned so far in the course. Group #4, comprised of Christopher Bartlett, Kelly Boyd, Apollo Vavra and Elizabeth Tucker, created a gaming app, Ice Runner. 

As per the Project README, we Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API. Handlebars.js is our template engine. We used MySQL and Sequelize for our database, and greated GET and POST routes for our data. New-to-us packages are Grunt, Phaser, and TypeScript.

## User Story

As a fan of online games, I want to play a new winter-themed game to celebrate the upcoming season.

WHEN I visit the site, I am prompted to Login or Create an Account.

WHEN I have successfully logged in, I am brought to the game, where I can use my arrow keys to navigate the snowman sprite around the gamescape, collecting snowballs.

WHEN I collect snowballs, I accumulate points.

WHEN I collect a certain number of points within a specified period of time, I win the game.

WHEN I win the game, my points are listed on the Leaderboard.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Navigate to the game site. You will be asked to either login using existing credentials, or prompted to create a new account. Once you have logged in (either with a legacy or new account), you will be able to play the game. Navigate the snowman sprite around the gamescape using the arrow keys, and accumulate points. When the timer runs out, you will be told whether you have won or lost. Wins will be posted to the Leaderboard. Refresh the page to play again.


## Challenges

Our biggest challenges and learning curves came from the process of creating and programming the game. After an aborted attempt at writing all of our files in TypeScript, we returned to our original language, JavaScript, with the exception of a few key files that still have the .ts extension. Phaser, our gaming engine, also presented a learning curve.

We ended up with a much simpler project than originally planned, but we are very happy with the results.
